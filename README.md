#Open Assessments Admin Tool

#Getting Started:
-----------------------

Make sure to install git and npm before you start then:

1. git clone https://github.com/atomicjolt/react_client_starter_app.git my_project_name
2. Rename .env.example to .env. This file contains the port the server will use. The default 8080 should be fine, but you can also use a local domain or ngrok if you wish.
3. npm install
4. Start server with:

  `npm run hot`

then visit http://localhost:8080


# Using the React Client Starter App
-----------------------
Source code lives in the client directory. Modify html and js files in that directory to build your application.


## React.js
-----------
React code can be found in client/js. We use Redux and the React-Router.


## Html
-----------
All html files live in client/html. The build process will properly process ejs in any html files as well as process markdown for files that end in .md. All front matter in .md files will be available to the ejs templates. See about.md for an example.


#Tests
-----------
Karma and Jasmine are used for testing. To run tests run:

  `npm run test`


#Check for updates
-----------
Inside the client directory run:

  `npm-check-updates`
